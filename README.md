# SMS Spam Classifier

## Overview

This project is an SMS Spam Classifier that utilizes machine learning algorithms to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. The classifier is built using Python, with a focus on pre-processing text data, feature extraction, and classification. It implements several algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to optimize performance and achieve high accuracy.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: The project implements Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines for classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed raw SMS data to remove unnecessary noise and standardize inputs.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilized techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization for converting text data into numerical features.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved high performance in classifying messages as spam or non-spam by optimizing models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Used precision, recall, and F1-score for model evaluation to ensure robust performance.
